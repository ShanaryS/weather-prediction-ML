# Weather Prediction using Machine Learning

Predict the weather conditions of a day in NYC or other large cities using various machine learning algorithms. Observe the accuracy of each model as well as use any to predict the weather conditions with a few input values. Prediction is split into 5 categories:

* Sky - Clear vs Cloudy
* Rain
* Thunderstorm
* Snow
* Fog - Mist and Haze included

This split allows the models to be properly fitted to a single feature rather than overextending themselves too thin.

Models were trained on data from: https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data?select=weather_description.csv.
Model is currently trained on NYC but can be easily swapped with other cities from the dataset.
